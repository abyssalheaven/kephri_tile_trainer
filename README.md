## Single File Executable

I know downloading .exe files is a bit sus, but I just compiled the two python scripts into a single standalone executable if you don't feel like dealing with installing & running python scripts.

`dist > ktt.exe`


## Python Installation

1. Download the Repo.
2. Install Python from python.org (when installed ensure to include PATH variable for windows).
3. In a terminal run the command `pip install dearpygui` which is the only Python libray needed.
4. Run the command `python gui.py` inside the folder to run the app!
